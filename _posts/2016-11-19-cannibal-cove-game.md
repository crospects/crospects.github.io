### Cannibal Cove
Cannibal Cove is a retro-style side scroller video game where you try to escape a cove full of blood-thristy cannibals. It starts easy, but don't be fooled. It gets hard fast.
#### How we made it
We made Cannibal Cove using Stencyl. A free application that can be used to create 2D games.
We also used [Piskel](http://piskelapp.com), wich is a free web app for creating frame-by-frame sprite-sheet animations. We used it to create all the graphics, and the animations for Mark, the main character. We hosted the final file on [MEGA](http://mega.nz), wich gives you 50gb of free online storage, and makes it easy to share your files with others. For paid downloads, we use Sellfy, wich is a very simple way to sell digital goods online.
#### Download
Cannibal Cove is a Shock Wave Flash game, meaning that you can download and run it using Adobe Flash Player. The game is in a `.swf` format, that can be read by Adobe Flash Player.
