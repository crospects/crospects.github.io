We've just updated our site! It is now much more compact, and light-weight, so it should load much faster on your devices. We are also now using Jekyll to generate the syte. Jekyll takes `.md` files and turns them into nice, clean `HTML` that we host using Github Pages. With this new method, we can release posts much faster, and without as much trouble
