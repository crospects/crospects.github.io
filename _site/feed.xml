&lt;p&gt;Cannibal Cove is a retro-style side scroller video game where you try to escape a cove full of blood-thristy cannibals. It starts easy, but don’t be fooled. It gets hard fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-we-made-it&quot;&gt;How we made it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made Cannibal Cove using Stencyl. A free application that can be used to create 2D games.
We also used &lt;a href=&quot;http://piskelapp.com&quot;&gt;Piskel&lt;/a&gt;, wich is a free web app for creating frame-by-frame sprite-sheet animations. We used it to create all the graphics, and the animations for Mark, the main character. We hosted the final file on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mega.nz&quot;&gt;MEGA&lt;/a&gt;, wich gives you 50gb of free online storage, and makes it easy to share your files with others. For paid downloads, we use Sellfy, wich is a very simple way to sell digital goods online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;download&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannibal Cove is a Shock Wave Flash game, meaning that you can download and run it using Adobe Flash Player. The game is in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.swf&lt;/code&gt; format, that can be read by Adobe Flash Player.&lt;/p&gt;
